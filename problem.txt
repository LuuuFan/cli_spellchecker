CLI spellchecker:

(note:  most unix systems have a file called words somewhere in /usr/share that has a bunch of words, one per line)
Implement a program that can be called from the cli like so:

$ ./spellcheck effortles
effortless

It should print out words that the the person typing the misspelled word might have meant.


words file path: /usr/share/dict
